This package is a MATLAB implementation of our papers:

Infrared Small Target Detection by Density Peaks Searching and Maximum-gray Region Growing.

If you use the code or data, please cite:

Suqi Huang, Zhenming Peng, Zhuoran Wang, Xiaoyang Wang, and Meihui Li, Infrared Small Target Detection By Density Peaks Searching and Maximum-gray Region Growing[J], IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 2019. (Accepted)

The code is supplied for educational purposes only.




Tips:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code includes two part: one is the class DensityPeaksIR, which includes all the fuctions about the proposed method; 
the other is main.m, which calls the class DensityPeaksIR to process an input image and presents the results.

We also provide some image samples presented in our paper. 

So just run the main.m in matlab, and you will get the detection results.
